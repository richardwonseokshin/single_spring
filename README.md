Friday Time Project: Simple single spring simulation (no dampening)

This project was created during Friday Time at Intrepid Pursuits. It is an Android application that simulates Hooke's law and renders to a view's onDraw method. The aim of this project is to provide a starting point to eventually create a simplified simulation of the surface of a liquid.
